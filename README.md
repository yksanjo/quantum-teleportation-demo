# Quantum Coin Demo ⚛️🪙

Interactive quantum computing demonstration showing superposition - a quantum coin that is heads **AND** tails simultaneously until measured.

## 🎯 The Demo

**Why it works:** Everyone understands coins.

- **Classical coin** → always heads OR tails
- **Quantum coin** → heads AND tails until measured
- Visual probability bars show superposition state
- "Measure" button collapses to a single state

**Wow moment:** "The quantum coin isn't undecided — it's genuinely in both states simultaneously until measurement collapses it to one!"

## ✨ Features

- Side-by-side classical vs quantum comparison
- Real-time probability visualization
- Interactive measurement collapse
- Beautiful, modern UI
- Runs in 30-60 seconds
- No math jargon - plain language explanations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎓 Educational Use

Perfect for:
- **Classrooms** - Students learning quantum superposition
- **Public Events** - Science fairs, museums, tech conferences
- **Business Presentations** - Demonstrating quantum concepts
- **Online Learning** - Interactive quantum education

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

1. **Superposition** - Quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously
2. **Measurement** - Observing a quantum state collapses it to a single value
3. **Probability** - Quantum mechanics is probabilistic, not deterministic
4. **Classical vs Quantum** - Clear comparison of classical and quantum behavior

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Modern UI framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful icons
- **Custom Quantum Simulator** - Educational quantum state simulation

## 📖 How It Works

The demo uses a simple quantum simulator that:
1. Creates a superposition state using the Hadamard gate
2. Shows probabilities of measuring |0⟩ (heads) or |1⟩ (tails)
3. Collapses the state when measured
4. Visualizes the entire process in real-time
